# Sequential Lab
Welcome to Sequential Lab!

We are a team of data scientists and engineers working towards automating and pushing the boundaries of solving local Saudi market business data problems through collaboration and open source. Our objective is to develop Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) that can be expanded with the help of the community.

Our lab provides a platform for young and aspiring data scientists to showcase their skills and learn from experts while solving real-world problems. We believe in the power of collaboration and open-source development, which is why we encourage community involvement in all our projects.

Our lab aims to bridge the gap between academia and industry by providing a platform for students and professionals to work together on projects that have real-world applications. We believe that this approach not only benefits the community but also helps in the development of the next generation of data scientists/engineers.

We are committed to creating a culture of continuous learning and improvement. We encourage our team members to learn new skills and technologies to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry.
